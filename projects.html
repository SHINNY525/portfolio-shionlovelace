                <p>Card Clash is a personal card game that I developed on the digital platform Tabletopia. In this two player game, players must dominate their opponents completely by strategizing and bringing out their inner beast to cause chaos in the battle arena! Become a commander to lead the team to a complete victory by taking time to strategize and understand the situation before making your move.<br><br>The digital assets for the game, including game boards, cards, and tokens, were designed using Figma.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvDm0uiYlqE&ab_channel=Shinny11" target="_blank">Watch How to Play Video</a>

                <p>Exercise is a very common way to be in shape. Health matters for everyone or at least for me, because I used to be a sports player myself. However, I don't do as much exercise as I used to before coming to college. Some reasons why you should be in shape is so that you can be healthy, helps mentally, and it can connect you to different people and even communities. But it's really hard now a days because we got a lot of things going on in life. So what can you do? I think taking 30 minutes of your day to do some type of exercise is enough. You might think that 30 minutes per day isn't very effective which I also thought before, but my mind completely changed since I started taking my time to actually exercise each day. To get straight to the point, it's harder than you think. You feel like you want to skip the day, every once in a while. That is why I like to play sports with my friends. We recently have been playing pickle ball and this also connected us to the pickle ball community. I love sports because the way it connects us to different people is just amazing. Being in shape is very important and you should keep in mind of your health too.</p>
