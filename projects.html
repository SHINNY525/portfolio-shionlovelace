            <div class="cardclash-text">
                <p>Card Clash is a personal card game that I developed on the digital platform Tabletopia. In this two player game, players must dominate their opponents completely by strategizing and bringing out their inner beast to cause chaos in the battle arena! Become a commander to lead the team to a complete victory by taking time to strategize and understand the situation before making your move.<br><br>The digital assets for the game, including game boards, cards, and tokens, were designed using Figma. You can view the design page and assets through the Figma link provided <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/iC8cMlyKdfaqhjauh5rC8A/Solo-Card-Game-Project?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas" target="_blank" class="other-links">here.</a> <br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvDm0uiYlqE&ab_channel=Shinny11" target="_blank" class="other-links">Watch How to Play Video</a>

            <h2>Eerie Woods</h2>
            <div class="eeriewoods-text">
                <p>Eerie Woods is a fictional game concept centered around horror and survival, where players must escape the haunted forest. The forest is filled with entities and unknown creatures that are trying to hunt you down.<br><br>I focused on the interface design for the fictional game. I made a total of 6 screens that includes the main menu, gameplay screen, pause menu, player inventory screen, and settings menu. Understanding the theme of the game, I made sure that all the screens were interconnected and fit the overall style. The design is also very simple, with minimal elements as possible for clarity.<br><br>The interface design for the game is created on Figma, which can be accessed from <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/VE6Eh1OvPHqHAAFploDW6Z/MI-332-Final-Project?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas" target="_blank" class="other-links">here.</a>

            <h2>Haunted</h2>
            <div class="haunted-text">
                <p>Haunted is a project I worked on as part of a 9 member team. It is a 4 to 8 player cooperative game where players must work together to complete the objectives in each of the four rooms within a haunted house.<br><br>Each team member had a role where I took part as a team manager to confirm tasks were completed on time. I also documented ideas and design progress to help the team understand the scope of the project. Additionally, I was in charge to design the rulebook for our game.

            <h2>Mobile Game UI Design</h2>
            <div class="mobile-game-ui-text">
                <p>This is a UI design for a non-existent mobile game. Although it doesn't relate to a specific game, its purpose is to understand the importance of designing in different platforms. Designing mobile interfaces is difficult due to having limited screen space and functionality. This leads to less flexibility in the design process.<br><br>The design consists a total of 3 interactable UIs, along with other indicator UIs on the screen. Keeping the interactables simple, can result in a user friendly experience.
