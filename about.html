            <h2>Hello! I'm Shion Lovelace.</h2>
            <p>I am currently an undergraduate student at Michigan State University pursuing a Bachelor's in Games and Interactive Media. I also have a Minor degree in Japanese and expect to graduate in the spring of 2026. While at MSU, I have consistently improved my skills to become a better game designer. I've worked on a variety of projects, both digital to non-digital, as well as in teams and independently.<br><br>I have experience in Game Design, UI/UX Design, Web Design, and several programming languages. The use of multiple software tools allows me to design and express my skill sets in a lot of different ways. My goal is to continue learning new skills and techniques, in addition to pushing myself to grow as a designer. <br><br>In 2022, I graduated from the Japanese School of Detroit where I studied the Japanese Language every Saturday since 2010. This experience has helped me develop the ability to read, write, speak, and understand Japanese at a native proficiency level. It also made me interested in Japanese culture and literature, which I have explored further through my minor program at MSU.<br><br>Outside of making games, I love to do a variety of things such as hanging out with friends, playing and watching sports, playing the cello, playing video games, and watching anime.</p>
